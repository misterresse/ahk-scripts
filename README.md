# Enjoy/Enhance your Keyboard and Mouse!

## Get started
This project provides ways to enhance your keyboard and mouse, to do more with less mouse-clicks or keyboard-hits.
And you may take advantages of those handsome scripts, in more than one ways! Here we go.
### The recommended way
For most people, ```we strongly recommend you to make use of them by the executables```, that is, the .exe files in the ```/bin``` directory, because ```you don't need to download or install any extra software```.
In this way, you just need to:
> Download the project by clicking the ```Download ZIP``` button at the upper-right on this page.
> Go to the /bin directory and run the ```.exe``` just my mouse click.
> Enjoy it.

### The alternative way
If you are a programmer, you may would like to work with [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) if you like, and in return you could take full control of those scripts.
Please follow the steps below to run the scripts you prefer.
> Down load AutoHotkey from [its official site](https://autohotkey.com/).
> Install AutoHotkey.
> Create ```.ahk``` file associations to AutoHotkey.
> Download the ```.ahk``` files to your computer.
> Right-click the prefered .ahk file and select ```Run Script```.

For more details, see [the documentation](https://autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm).
